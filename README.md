# Verilog Basics Projects

## Overview

This repository contains Verilog projects that focus on the fundamentals of digital design, specifically combinatorial and sequential circuits. The projects include both the Verilog code for the circuits and their corresponding testbenches for verification. The development environment used for these projects is Xilinx Vivado.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Combinational Circuit

- Description: Implement a basic combinational circuit using Verilog.
- Files:
  - `combinational_circuit_example1.v`: Verilog code for the combinational circuit.
  - `combinational_circuit_tb_example1.v`: Testbench for the combinational circuit.

### 2. Sequential Circuit

- Description: Design a simple sequential circuit using Verilog.
- Files:
  - `sequential_circuit_example1.v`: Verilog code for the sequential circuit.
  - `sequential_circuit_tb_example1.v`: Testbench for the sequential circuit.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamparmar1/Verilog-Basics.git

2. Navigate to the specific project folder (e.g., combinational_circuit or sequential_circuit).

3. Open the project files using Xilinx Vivado.

## Running Simulations

Follow these steps to run simulations using Xilinx Vivado:

1. Open Xilinx Vivado.

2. Create a new project and add the Verilog files from the respective project folder.

3. Launch simulation and observe the waveform to verify the circuit behavior.
